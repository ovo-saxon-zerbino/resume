                <h1>Profile</h1>
                <p>
                    I am currently a software engineering manager, but have been a full-stack engineer
                    since 2018. Over the last year I have been focusing on supporting 2 teams of software engineers to build
                    business focused solutions as part of a wider squad of 4 teams, including delivering a Camunda-based 
                    platform for business process automation which is being used to optimise business processes & remove 
                    histortic grey IT with robust solutions owned by tech. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My focus over this time has been on collaborating with our PMs to refine business requirements, 
                    support the engineers' personal developement, optimise team performance and help build an 
                    autonomous, accountable dev culture. I have led and coached others through system design, with a 
                    focus on iterative development and realising value early, implemented an internal RFC system for 
                    enabling autonomous distributed decision making, set technical direction and built tooling to enable
                    engineers to move at speed. While I have never worked in a dedicated DevOps role I have a keen interest
                    in infrastructure and continuous delivery and as such have had the opportunity to build many skills in this area, 
                    including leading our squad's platform engineering team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am eager to return to a more hands-on engineering role as I enjoy solving software problems. During
                    my time at OVO my primary language has been Kotlin but I consider myself to be a generalist and am willing
                    to work in any language.

                <p>
                    I have worked in 2 business functions during my time at OVO: field services, & industry operations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my time with field services my squad developed Zeno, our system for the installation of smart
                    meters, and other zero-carbon living technologies & optimise the effectiveness of our on-site engineers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of the squad I acted as a full-stack engineer working in Kotlin, Flutter, & React to develop our
                    applications. I also worked as part of our production engineering team to support developer experience
                    & support the reliability of our systems and tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The industry operations squad was created in 2022 to develop new tooling to automate manual processes
                    resolve settlement gap and support onboarding new customers who export energy to the grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of the squad I acted as an individual contributor across 2 teams. I was responsible for 
                    supporting the team in designing robust serverless systems, leading cross-team initiatives such as
                    improving local developer experience, & embedding best practices for agile delivery, reliability, &
                    software engineering ways of working.

                    I joined Valtech as a graduate in 2018, later progressing to the role of developer in June 2019. During this
                    time I worked on projects for easyJet and MAC cosmetics. My mentors put a strong focus on code cleanliness
                    and maintainability. I later onboarded newer graduate developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work for easyJet was focussed on their easyjet.com website, core booking funnel and post-booking upsell 
                    journeys. The site was built with a mix of .NET, Sitecore CMS, AngularJs, React utilising a microservice
                    architecture. During my time on the project the team underwent an agile transformation which gave me 
                    exposure to agile best practices. I took ownership of improving the teams processes around documentation
                    and testing.

                <p>
                    For MAC Cosmetics I worked as part of a team to develop microservice APIs to support a connected retail
                    experience being developed by a team in the United States. Our APIs were developed in .NET core 3.1
                    and hosted on Kubernetes in Azure.

                    For my dissertation I worked with the Interactions group at Bristol University on the Gorilla Game Lab
                    project for Bristol Zoo. It was written in C++ built on the OpenFrameworks platform. My project uses classic

                    the objects introduced by the team to provide data to determine how effective different designs were at

                <p>
                    Outside of work I am a keen fan of music and art, and I try to juggle both playing guitar and drawing. I
                    also am an indoor gardener and have around 30 plants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy improving my understanding of computing outside work, I have recently been exploring Svelte as
                    an alternative more lightweight frontend framework for my personal portfolio website. Previously I have
                    used Project Euler to improve my functional programming and mathematics knowledge.
