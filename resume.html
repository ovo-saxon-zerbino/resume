                    In April, I transitioned into a leadership role, managing 10 engineers across 2 teams. One delivering
                    a centralised capability for industry data ingestion in response to changes driven by the MHHS
                    regulatory programme. The other, a horizontal platform team supporting 3 other teams in the operations
                    domain. I take a people-centric approach to leadership, focusing on mentoring, goal setting & create direct
                    growth opportunities for engineers. I foster a culture of  ownership, early delivery, and resilient
                    iterative development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Partnering closely with product, delivery, and stakeholders, I lead teams through the full delivery
                    lifecycle — from discovery to solution design, implementation, and release management. Taking full
                    accountability for my teams' delivery outcomes.

                    <li>
                        Built a Camunda-powered process automation platform, replacing legacy "grey IT" tools and enabling

                    In Field Tech, my squad owned OVO’s internal field services platform, Zeno, used to schedule and
                    install smart meters. I contributed to frontend applications using Flutter, and React, and a
                    microservice API developed using Kotlin. I had a keen focus on developer tooling, system reliability,
                    and infrastructure automation, driven by my interest in CI/CD and scalable engineering practices.

                    When the Industry Operations squad was launched in 2022 I worked as an individual contributor across
                    two new teams, building robust serverless systems and leading initiatives to improve local developer
                    experience and end-to-end test automation.

                    I joined Valtech as a graduate in 2018, later progressing to the role of developer in June 2019. During this
                    time I worked on projects for easyJet and MAC cosmetics. My mentors put a strong focus on code cleanliness
                    and maintainability. I later carried this ethos forward as I onboarded newer graduate developers.

                <p>
                    My work for easyJet was focussed on their easyjet.com website, core booking funnel and post-booking upsell 
                    journeys. The site was built with a mix of .NET, Sitecore CMS, AngularJs, & React utilising a microservice
                    architecture. During my time on the project the team underwent an agile transformation which gave me 
                    exposure to agile best practices. I took ownership of improving the teams processes around documentation
                    and testing.

                <p>
                    For MAC Cosmetics I worked as part of a team to develop microservice APIs to support a connected retail
                    experience being developed by a team in the United States. Our APIs were developed in .NET core 3.1
                    and hosted on Kubernetes in Azure. I took ownership of our infrastructure and led on designing our
                    data architecture using Cosmos DB NoSQL.
