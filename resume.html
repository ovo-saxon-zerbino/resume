                <h1>Profile</h1>
                <p>
                    I am currently a software engineering manager, but have been a full-stack engineer
                    since 2018. Over the last year I have been focusing on supporting 2 teams of software engineers to build
                    business focused solutions as part of a wider squad of 4 teams, including delivering a Camunda-based 
                    platform for business process automation which is being used to optimise business processes & remove 
                    histortic grey IT with robust solutions owned by tech. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am eager to return to a more hands-on engineering role as I enjoy solving software problems. During
                    my time at OVO my primary language has been Kotlin but I consider myself to be a generalist and am willing
                    to work in any language.

                <p>
                    In April I was given the opportunity to step up into a team leadership role as the squad grew. This
                    meant moving away from directly implementing software and instead leading on requirements gathering,
                    system design and setting our technical direction. Alongside this I have taken on line management
                    duties for 10 engineers, supporting their personal development and career goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By collaborating with our product managers, business analysts, delivery managers, & stakeholders I
                    have supported 2 teams (of a squad of 4) through identifying business problems, sizing and
                    prioritising initiatives, intial discovery & scoping, solution design, delivery and finally release
                    management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I pride myself on being a people-centric leader and have worked hard to set a culture where engineers
                    feel empowered to take ownership of our platform and our outcomes, deliver business value early and
                    iterate toward a stable, resilient product. I have worked transparently with my teams to optimise
                    team performance colaboratively to meet business needs sustainably.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this time my teams have delivered a Camunda-based platform for process automation which is
                    being used to optimise business processes & remove histortic grey IT with robust solutions owned by
                    tech. As a squad we are now working on building a robust operations platform to meet drastic change
                    in OVO's processes and communication with our third party suppliers as part of the MHHS programme.

                    I have worked as an engineer in 2 business areas at OVO: field tech, & industry operations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While in field tech my squad developed OVO's internal field services product. This was used for the
                    scheduling & installation of smart meters, and other zero-carbon living technologies.

                <p>
                    As a full-stack engineer I worked in Kotlin, Flutter, & React to develop our applications. I also
                    worked as part of our platform engineering team to improve developer experience & support of our
                    systems. I undertook this role as I had a keen interest in infrastructure, automation and
                    continuous delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The industry ops squad was launched in 2022, I acted as an individual contributor across the 2 
                    initial teams. I was responsible for supporting building robust serverless systems, leading 
                    cross-team initiatives such as improving local developer experience, end-to-end test automation.
                </p>

                    I joined Valtech as a graduate in 2018, later progressing to the role of developer in June 2019. During this
                    time I worked on projects for easyJet and MAC cosmetics. My mentors put a strong focus on code cleanliness
                    and maintainability. I later onboarded newer graduate developers.

                <p>
                    My work for easyJet was focussed on their easyjet.com website, core booking funnel and post-booking upsell 
                    journeys. The site was built with a mix of .NET, Sitecore CMS, AngularJs, React utilising a microservice
                    architecture. During my time on the project the team underwent an agile transformation which gave me 
                    exposure to agile best practices. I took ownership of improving the teams processes around documentation
                    and testing.

                <p>
                    For MAC Cosmetics I worked as part of a team to develop microservice APIs to support a connected retail
                    experience being developed by a team in the United States. Our APIs were developed in .NET core 3.1
                    and hosted on Kubernetes in Azure.

                <p>
                    Outside of work I am a keen fan of music and art, and I try to juggle both playing guitar and drawing. I
                    also am an indoor gardener and have around 30 plants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy improving my understanding of computing outside work, I have recently been exploring Svelte as
                    an alternative more lightweight frontend framework for my personal portfolio website. Previously I have
                    used Project Euler to improve my functional programming and mathematics knowledge.
