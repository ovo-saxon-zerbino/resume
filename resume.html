                <p>
                    I've worked across two business areas at OVO: Field Tech and Industry Operations. I have consistently
                    utilised core agile techniques including Scrum, user-centred design, and push-left QA.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the start of the year I transitioned to lead engineer on the Industry Operations platform team.
                    My team supports the replatforming of our domain's products onto OVO's future tech stack as part of
                    a wider digital transformation initiative, supporting 3 other teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role blends development, technical discovery, design, and cross-team enablement. To date I've led
                    two key initiatives:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Monitoring & Observability Migration: Delivered a phased migration from Grafana to Datadog, using
                        Terraform to standardize dashboards across 8 systems and migrate 40+ dashboards without loss of
                        visibility. This improved observability standards and reduced setup effort for new services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cloud Platform Adoption: Leading adoption of OVO's Kubernetes-based cloud platform, Evergreen,
                        hosted on GCP. Conducting gap analysis, collaborating with my SEM and the Evergreen team to manage
                        regulatory constraints, while planning phased adoption for the as many of our products as is
                        feasible.

                <p>
                    Transitioning into a leadership role from engineering, I took ownership of 10 engineers across 2
                    teams. One focused on industry data ingestion, driven by changes from the MHHS regulatory programme.
                    The other, a platform SRE team supporting 3 others. I am people-first, emphasising mentoring and
                    direct growth opportunities, with a culture of ownership, early delivery, and iterative development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Partnering closely with product, delivery, and stakeholders, I lead teams through the full delivery
                    lifecycle â€” from discovery to solution design, implementation, and release management. Taking full
                    accountability for my teams' delivery outcomes.

                    <li>
                        Built a Camunda-powered process automation platform, replacing legacy "grey IT" tools and enabling

                    In Field Tech, my squad owned OVO's internal field services platform, Zeno, used to schedule and
                    install smart meters. I contributed to frontend applications using Flutter, and React, and a
                    microservice API developed using Kotlin. I had a keen focus on developer tooling, system reliability,
                    and infrastructure automation, driven by my interest in CI/CD and scalable engineering practices.

                <p>
                    When the Industry Operations squad was launched in 2022 I worked as an individual contributor across
                    two new teams, building robust serverless systems and leading initiatives to improve local developer
                    experience and end-to-end test automation.

                    I joined Valtech as a graduate in 2018, later progressing to the role of developer in June 2019. During this
                    time I worked on projects for easyJet and MAC cosmetics. My mentors put a strong focus on code cleanliness
                    and maintainability. I later carried this ethos forward as I onboarded newer graduate developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work for easyJet was focussed on the easyjet.com website, core booking funnel and post-booking
                    upsell journeys. The site was built with a mix of .NET, Sitecore CMS, AngularJs, & React utilising
                    a microservice architecture. My time on the project gave me exposure to agile best practices
                    including Scrum and SAFe. I ownered the teams processes around documentation and testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For MAC Cosmetics I worked as part of a team to develop microservice APIs to support a connected retail
                    experience being developed by a team in the United States. Our APIs were developed in .NET core 3.1
                    and hosted on Kubernetes in Azure. I took ownership of our infrastructure and led on designing our
                    data architecture using Cosmos DB NoSQL.
