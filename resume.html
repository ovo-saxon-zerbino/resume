                <p>
                    I am a full-stack software developer who has been in industry since August 2018. I am a University of
                    Bristol graduate where I studied a BSc. In Computer Science. I love to explore new technologies and
                    pride myself on being adaptable. I am particularly interested in exploring the role of computing in
                    sustainability and how software can be developed responsibly to reduce Its environmental impact.

                <p>
                    I have worked in 2 business functions during my time at OVO: field services, & industry operations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my time with field services my squad developed Zeno, our system for the installation of smart
                    meters, and other zero-carbon living technologies & optimise the effectiveness of our on-site engineers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of the squad I acted as a full-stack engineer working in Kotlin, Flutter, & React to develop our
                    applications. I also worked as part of our production engineering team to support developer experience
                    & support the reliability of our systems and tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The industry operations squad was created in 2022 to develop new tooling to automate manual processes
                    resolve settlement gap and support onboarding new customers who export energy to the grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of the squad I acted as an individual contributor across 2 teams. I was responsible for 
                    supporting the team in designing robust serverless systems, leading cross-team initiatives such as
                    improving local developer experience, & embedding best practices for agile delivery, reliability, &
                    software engineering ways of working.

                    I joined Valtech as a graduate in 2018, later progressing to the role of developer in June 2019. During this
                    time I worked on projects for easyJet and MAC cosmetics. My mentors put a strong focus on code cleanliness
                    and maintainability. I later onboarded newer graduate developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work for easyJet was focussed on their easyjet.com website, core booking funnel and post-booking upsell 
                    journeys. The site was built with a mix of .NET, Sitecore CMS, AngularJs, React utilising a microservice
                    architecture. During my time on the project the team underwent an agile transformation which gave me 
                    exposure to agile best practices. I took ownership of improving the teams processes around documentation
                    and testing.

                <p>
                    For MAC Cosmetics I worked as part of a team to develop microservice APIs to support a connected retail
                    experience being developed by a team in the United States. Our APIs were developed in .NET core 3.1
                    and hosted on Kubernetes in Azure.

                    For my dissertation I worked with the Interactions group at Bristol University on the Gorilla Game Lab
                    project for Bristol Zoo. It was written in C++ built on the OpenFrameworks platform. My project uses classic

                    the objects introduced by the team to provide data to determine how effective different designs were at

                    Outside of work I am a keen fan of music and art, and I try to juggle both playing guitar and drawing. I
                    also am an indoor gardener and have around 30 plants.

                <p>
                    I enjoy improving my understanding of computing outside work, I have recently been exploring Svelte as
                    an alternative more lightweight frontend framework for my personal portfolio website. Previously I have
                    used Project Euler to improve my functional programming and mathematics knowledge.
