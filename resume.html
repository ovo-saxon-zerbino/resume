                <p>
                    I am a full-stack software developer who has been in industry since August 2018. I am a University of
                    Bristol graduate where I studied a BSc. In Computer Science. I love to explore new technologies and
                    pride myself on being adaptable. I am particularly interested in exploring the role of computing in
                    sustainability and how software can be developed responsibly to reduce Its environmental impact.

                    I have worked within 2 core business functions during my time at OVO: field services, & industry operations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my time with field services my squad responsible for developing a backend system, and supporting frontend
                    applications to optimise utilisation of a fleet of on-site engineers as well as to enable the installation of
                    smart meters & other zero-carbon living technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within industry operations I was brought on as an individual contributor across 2 teams responsible for 
                    developing greenfield software solutions to develop automations to replace existing manual processes to support
                    identification of potential lost revenue via incorrect meter reads, and support onboarding of new customers who
                    supply energy to the grid.

                    <p>August 2018 – August 2020</p>
                </header>
                <p>
                    I joined Valtech as a graduate in 2018, later progressing to the role of developer in June 2019. During this
                    time I have worked on 2 clients, easyJet and MAC cosmetics. I have also been fortunate to achieve
                    certification with the Sitecore CMS. My mentors at Valtech put a strong focus on code cleanliness and
                    maintainability, based on the works of Robert Martin. I have also had the opportunity to pass on my
                    knowledge to some of the graduates who have joined in 2019 which has allowed me to reinforce my own
                    understanding and improve how I communicate technical concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work on easyJet was focussed on the easyjet.com website, which consists of an older C# monolith
                    application around the Sitecore CMS, with an AngularJs frontend, as well as a more recent React
                    and .NET core microservice architecture intended to replace the older website. During this time our team
                    has undergone an agile transformation which has given me much exposure to agile best practices. On the
                    team I was able to take ownership in maturing the teams processes around documentation and testing. I
                    was able to build a sustainable test platform on Jest and Cypress and demonstrate to the team how to
                    write effective tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work for MAC Cosmetics was as part of a team developing a collection of microservice APIs to
                    support a connected retail experience being developed by a team in the United States. Our APIs were
                    developed in .NET core 3.1 and hosted on Kubernetes in Azure.

                </p>
                <p>
                    For my dissertation I worked with the Interactions group at Bristol University on the Gorilla Game Lab
                    project. My work was written in C++ built on the OpenFrameworks platform. My project uses classical
                    computer vision techniques to track animal movement and interaction with the objects introduced by the
                    team to provide data to determine how effective different designs were at getting the animals attention.

                    Record Keeper for Discogs
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of the project is to use Discogs.com public APIs to track desirable records and notify users when
                    records they are interested in become available.
                    The backend architecture is written in Node.js, and run in Docker using MariaDB to store user
                    information. The frontend was developed as a Vue.js app to allow greater interactivity to users and let me
                    explore animation and motion design.

                    Outside of work I am a keen fan of music and art, and I try to juggle both playing guitar and drawing. I
                    also am an indoor gardener and have around 30 plants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy improving my understanding of computing outside work, I have recently been exploring Svelte as
                    an alternative more lightweight frontend framework for my personal portfolio website. Previously I have
                    used Project Euler to improve my functional programming and mathematics knowledge.
